# Submission guidance

CUI 2021 has switched from page limits to approximate word-limits. Word limits are somewhat relaxed but not that papers which substantially exceed these limits may be desk rejected. We ask authors to stick to the spirit of the word length.

Submissions for all tracks except Featured Talks must be made by the conference submission system, details of which will be available soon.

## Rebuttals

This year we have introduced rebuttals for the Full Papers track, allowing authors to respond to the reviewers before a final decision is made on papers by the Full Papers chairs. Rebuttals will be made through the conference submission system.

## Accessibility

We ask all authors to prepare **an accessible submission** by marking up your documents with correct styles and features including tables and equations, setting text descriptions for all figures, not relying on colour to distinguish elements. The [CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission ](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission "Read the CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission") should be followed as closely as possible, and provides useful guidance for doing this.

## Policies on submission

By submitting to the conference, you are agreeing to the following:
* You must anonymise your submission (The [CHI Anonymization Policy Submissions](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/chi-anonymization-policy "Read the CHI conference policy on Anonymisation") is helpful)
* You must use ACM’s in-text citation style and reference formats (see the [Citation Style and Reference Formats](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting "Read the ACM policy on Citation Style and Reference Formats"))  
* Submissions found to not adhere to the [ACM’s policies on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview "Read the ACM policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification") will be rejected   
* Authors and reviewers will be asked to indicate their understanding and acceptance of the [ACM Policy on Conflict of Interest in Publication](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest "Read the Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications")  when items are submitted and reviewed
* Papers submitted to conference cannot be under consideration for any other conference or publication (no simultaneous submissions) and cannot be previously published without undergoing substantial revision ([Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions "Read the ACM policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous"))
