# Welcome to CUI

There has been an increasing interest in language-based interactions with technology. Driven by the commercial success of intelligent personal assistant devices such as Alexa and Google Home, the number of natural language and conversation-based interactions is growing in commercial settings. Following the successful inaugural ACM In-Cooperation conference in 2019 and the virtual conference in 2020, CUI 2021 aims to further develop a collaborative community around human-computer interaction issues in speech and language technology, with a specific interest in theory-based and applied scientific issues in the field of speech and text-based conversational user interfaces. Thus CUI 2021 further looks to bring together relevant communities (e.g. ISCA, ACM SIGCHI, CogSci) to publish, disseminate and showcase high-quality cutting-edge research related to the field, promote insight and debate in this interesting and important discipline within language interfaces.

Topics relevant to the conference include, but are not limited to:
* voice user experience
* speech interfaces
* speech interface theory development
* conversational interaction through technology
* text-based conversational interfaces
* chatbots
* speech synthesis
* speech recognition
* dialogue management
* conversational interface design insights
* conversational search
* methods for conversational user interface development and evaluation
* multimodal interaction involving speech, text or other language based interfaces
