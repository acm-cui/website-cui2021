# Welcome to CUI

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xl-8 col-lg-7 col-md-6 col-12">
		<p>
		Following the successful ACM In-Cooperation CUI conferences in 2019 and 2020, CUI 2021 will be a <strong>hybrid conference with sessions online and in person in Bilbao, Spain</strong>. The conference will run from <strong>27th to 29th July 2021</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		We plan to use the conference as a platform to further develop a collaborative community around human-computer interaction issues in speech and language technology, with a specific interest in theory-based and applied scientific issues in the field of speech and text-based conversational user interfaces. We are looking to bring together relevant communities (e.g. ISCA, ACM SIGCHI, CogSci) to publish, disseminate and showcase high-quality cutting-edge research related to the field, promote insight and debate in this interesting and important discipline within language interfaces. Topics relevant to the conference include, but are not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>voice user experience</li>
			<li>speech interfaces</li>
			<li>speech interface theory development</li>
			<li>conversational interaction through technology</li>
			<li>text-based conversational interfaces</li>
			<li>chatbots</li>
			<li>speech synthesis</li>
			<li>speech recognition</li>
			<li>dialogue management</li>
			<li>conversational interface design insights</li>
			<li>conversational search</li>
			<li>methods for conversational user interface development and evaluation</li>
			<li>multimodal interaction involving speech, text or other language based interfaces</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			The CUI community has been growing at a rapid pace these past few years and we are continuing to develop the conference series. This year we have expanded the event to cover three days, allowing for the conference to remain single-track. We have five separate submission tracks, details of which can be found on the various call for papers in the <em>Authors</em> menu.
		</p>

		<p>
			We hope you can join us,<br>CUI 2021 organising committee
