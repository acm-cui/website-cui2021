# Welcome to !!conference.short_name!!
  
<div class="mb-4 alert alert-secondary d-none" role="alert">
  <p>Dear community,</p>
  <p>The {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} Organising Committee has made the difficult decision to run {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} as an online-only virtual conference. We had been hoping and planning to welcome as many of you as possible to Bilbao this year as part of a hybrid event, but the challenges of running a conference during the on-going pandemic, with slow vaccine rollouts across the globe and difficulties for international travellers, have precipitated a change in direction.</p> 
  <p>This decision was not taken lightly but the committee felt it was necessary. Our focus will now shift to making sure {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} is the most engaging and thoroughly enjoyable virtual conference.</p>
  <p class="mb-0"><em>{{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} Organising Committee<br>Thursday 4th March 2021</em></p>

		Following the successful ACM In-Cooperation {{ site.conference.short_name }} conferences in 2019 and 2020, {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} will be an <strong>{{ site.conference.location }}</strong>. The conference will run from <strong>{{ site.conference.dates }}</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		We plan to use the conference as a platform to further develop a collaborative community around human-computer interaction issues in speech and language technology, with a specific interest in theory-based and applied scientific issues in the field of speech and text-based conversational user interfaces. We are looking to bring together relevant communities (e.g. ISCA, ACM SIGCHI, CogSci) to publish, disseminate and showcase high-quality cutting-edge research related to the field, promote insight and debate in this interesting and important discipline within language interfaces. Topics relevant to the conference include, but are not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>voice user experience</li>
			<li>speech interfaces</li>
			<li>speech interface theory development</li>
			<li>conversational interaction through technology</li>
			<li>text-based conversational interfaces</li>
			<li>chatbots</li>
			<li>speech synthesis</li>
			<li>speech recognition</li>
			<li>dialogue management</li>
			<li>conversational interface design insights</li>
			<li>conversational search</li>
			<li>methods for conversational user interface development and evaluation</li>
			<li>multimodal interaction involving speech, text or other language based interfaces</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			The {{ site.conference.short_name }} community has been growing at a rapid pace these past few years and we are continuing to develop the conference series. This year we have expanded the event to cover three days, allowing for the conference to remain single-track. We have five separate submission types, with all papers, posters, and demos published in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/" title="Visit the ACM Digital Library">ACM Digital Library</a>. See the <em>For Authors</em> menu for more details.

			We hope you can join us,<br>{{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} Organising Committee
