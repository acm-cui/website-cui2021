  <p>This page is a summary of research presented online at the <a href="https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2021/">Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)</a> conference in July 2021. It describes the initial outputs of a study exploring aeroplane pilots' views on introducing conversational digital assistants into the cockpit.</p>

  <p>The research was funded by the <a href="https://law.unimelb.edu.au/centres/caide/research/from-pockets-to-cockpits">Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Ethics</a> at the University of Melbourne.

  <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
  <p>Interactions with intelligent systems have become common in domestic and professional life. However, little is known about how pilots, who already work in a highly automated environment, envisage using intelligent systems in their work environment. This preliminary analysis investigates pilots’ needs and wants for digital flight assistants (DFAs) through an interview study. We show that the adoption of DFAs may be hindered by pre-existing concerns, such as inadequate automatic speech recognition, linked to past experiences with digital assistants. Furthermore, we identify important contextual and environmental factors that will need to be accounted for in the design of DFAs such as “cross cockpit” relationships, noisy environments, or pilot’s cognitive workload.</p>

  <h2>METHOD</h2>
  <p>We conducted semi-structured online interviews with fifteen aeroplane pilots in Oct-Dec 2020, during a time period when many flights were grounded worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were transcribed, and a thematic analysis was conducted on the transcripts.</p>

  <h2>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</h2>
  <p>We identified three main themes from the interviews:</p>

  <h3>Technology Adoption and Curiosity</h3>
  <p>The pilots were generally positive about new technologies for automation both at home and in the cockpit. However, they expressed reservations about the utility of a voice-based interface: “Would there be any benefit for it to be audible?” Participants were concerned about the added stress of missing a vocal notification from the DFA, due to the abundance of other sounds and background noises in the cockpit.</p>

  <h3>Hierarchy on the Workfloor</h3>
  <p>Many of the pilots were concerned about how the presence of a DFA would affect the working relationships aboard the plane by introducing friction or challenging existing lines of authority between captains, first officers and flight crew. They felt that it was important for a DFA to be able to switch between more proactive and reactive modes of behaviour depending on the situation, and that it should not take such a prominent role in the cockpit that it would disrupt the pilots' collaboration and teaching/learning.</p>
  
  <h3>Digital Flight Assistants’ Perceived Utility</h3>
  <p>The pilots had an overall positive outlook on the future prospects for DFAs, although some were dubious about whether a DFA could meet the aviation industry's exacting standards for reliability. They anticipated three main advantages to DFAs:</p>
  <ol>    
    <li>Increased safety in time-critical scenarios, such as retrieving information about diversion options due to bad weather ahead of time.</li>
	<li>Pilot monitoring, so that if a pilot made a mistake or appeared to be in an impaired state, an “emotionally intelligent” DFA could alert them.</li>
	<li>Integration of existing distributed systems into one centralised interface.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These were generally agreed to be most advantageous in single-pilot flights.</p>

  <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
  <p>The pilots in our study demonstrated a high level of personal and professional curiosity towards new automated technologies, but flagged several ways in which a digital assistant would have to be tailored to the aviation context. The noisiness of the cockpit environment raises a challenge and potential safety concerns for voice-based interaction.</p>

  <p>Single-pilot flights were identified as a particularly valuable setting for a hypothetical DFA. In a multi-pilot cockpit, participants felt that it would be important for a DFA to be able to "read" and response to the relational context. Some form of "emotionally intelligent" DFA was considered ideal.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, the preliminary results of this research suggest ways that conversational digital assistants for aviation will need to be adapted to the specific cyber-physical-social activities that they are intended to enhance.</p>
