          <p class="abstract"><span class="abstract-word">Abstract.</span> Recent research suggests that deliberately manipulating a chatbot’s personality and matching it to the user’s personality can positively impact the user experience. Yet, little is known about whether this similarity attraction effect also applies to the personality dimension agreeableness. In a lab experiment, 30 participants interacted with three versions of an agreeable chatbot (agreeable, neutral, and disagreeable). Whilst our results corroborate a similarity attraction effect between user agreeableness and their preference for the agreeable chatbot, we did not find a reversed relationship with a disagreeable chatbot. Our findings point to a need for moderate instead of extreme chatbot personalities.</p>

              <p>Chatbots are considered social actors, with users unconsciously assigning them personalities [Nass et al. 1994]. Similar to human-human interaction, <b>users prefer chatbots with personalities similar to their own</b>, coined the similarity attraction effect [Nass and Lee 2001]. For example in prior work, matching user and chatbot personality had a positive impact on user engagement, users’ self-disclosure, and their willingness to accept the chatbot’s advice [Shumanov et al. 2021, Gwenuch et al. 2020].
              </br></br>
              In this work, we examine the similarity attraction effect for the personality trait agreeableness which seems particularly interesting for chatbot assistants. Agreeableness is a Big Five personality dimension and describes a tendency to be <b>trustful, genuine, modest, obliging, helpful, and cooperative</b> [McCrae and Costa 2008]. However, it is <b>questionable whether the preference for agreeable chatbots also follows a similarity attraction effect</b>: Whilst agreeable users are likely to favour an agreeable chatbot, disagreeable users might not expect an uncooperative, unhelpful chatbot, given that these characteristics are usually not associated with assistants.

            <p>To investigate our research questions, we conducted a within-groups lab experiment with 30 participants. In this experiment, participants interacted with three different versions of a chatbot, situated in a film recommender application: An agreeable chatbot, a neutral chatbot, and a disagreeable chatbot. After each interaction, we asked participants to specify their perception of the chatbot’s agreeableness by filling out a standard personality questionnaire [Danner et al. 2016]. Second, participants indicated how much they would like to interact with this chatbot again. At the end of the study, we collected participants’ self-reported level of agreeableness via the same personality questionnaire [Danner et al. 2016].</p>

        <h2>Chatbots</h2>

        <p>To imbue the chatbot with personality, we drew upon a plethora of work in psychology and linguistics that has examined how personality is manifested through human language. That is, we <b>leverage verbal cues which are associated with human agreeableness to manipulate the chatbots’ language styles</b>.

            The agreeable chatbot agrees with the user on opinions and expresses interpersonal concern. Furthermore, the agreeable chatbot employs positive emotions words such as “nice” or “like”, family-related word such as “together” or “family”, words indicating certainty such as “I’m sure”, as well as blushing and kiss emojis, as informed by previous research.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            The neutral chatbot showcases a neutral and polite language, neither expressing positive nor negative emotions in contrast to the other two versions. Moreover, it does not show a reaction to the user’s choices, yet communicates in a respectful and professional way.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            The disagreeable chatbot is pugnacious, critical, uncooperative, and does not show any interest in the user. On top of that, it is equipped with negative emotion words such as “bad”, swear words such as “crap”, mannerisms such as “so” and “okay”, along with expressions of anger (e.g., “I’m getting angry.”).

            <h3>Agreeableness Manipulation Check</h3>
            <p>Overall, the manipulation was successful, with the agreeable chatbot being perceived as more agreeable than the neutral chatbot, and the disagreeable chatbot. However, participants found the neutral chatbot also rather agreeable. 
            A Greenhouse-Geisser corrected repeated-measures ANOVA underpins these results, pointing to significant differences between the three versions (F(1.67, 48.33) = 381.12, p < .001, &eta;&sup2; = 0.93). Pairwise post-hoc tests yielded significant differences between all three pairs (p < .001).</p>

          <div class="col-7 align-self-center">
            <h3>Desire to Interact with Chatbot</h3>
            <p> Participants preferred interacting again with the agreeable and neutral chatbots, whilst the desire to chat with the disagreeable version was rather low on average. A Friedman test determined a significant effect of the chatbot on participants’ desire to interact with the chatbot (&chi;&sup2;(2) = 36.94, p < .001). Pairwise Nemenyi post-hoc tests yielded significant differences between the agreeable and disagreeable chatbots (p = .001) as well as between neutral and disagreeable chatbots (p = .001). There was no significant difference between participants’ desire to interact with the agreeable or neutral chatbot.</br>
            </br>
            A Spearman's rank correlation demonstrated only a significant, moderate positive relationship between participants’ agreeableness and their preference for the agreeable chatbot (&rho; = 0.47, p = .008).
